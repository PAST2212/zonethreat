**Domain / TLD Zone File Monitoring for Brand and Mailing Domain Names**

**New in Version 2.0**
- Add Multiprocessing and Multithreading to speed up performance drastically

In opposite to my other projects which depends on newest data feed, here you can monitor directly in the domain zone files that are published by domain authorities (e.g. ICANN).

One advantage is to scan **millions over millions** of currently registered domains for one specific TLD at a time (e.g. .com / .net / .info, etc.) to find **brand impersonations**, **close cousins of confusingly similar looking domains** or using results for further data engineering / crime investigation operations.

Here I scan as an example all currently **registered 9.757.861 .info Domains** for brand or phishing domains in one batch. Please keep in mind that one scan operation could take time.

**Necessary Condition:**
- Create a free account at https://czds.icann.org/home and request free access to the relevant TLDs / Domain Zone Files you want to scan (.com / .org / .net , etc.). Filetypes are .txt files
- Take another source (e.g. paid source) if you already have one

**You can recognize:**
- combo squatting (e.g. amazon-shop.com), 
- typo squatting (ammazon.com), 
- brand impersonations, 
- phishing attacks (e.g. CEO-Fraud),
- and other forms of phishing websites / look-alike Domains (e.g. ùóâayùûÄal.com - greek letter RHO 'ùûÄ' instead of latin letter 'p')

**Features:**
- Multithreading (50 workers by defaul) & Multiprocessing
- False Positive Reduction Instruments (self defined Blacklists, Thresholds depending on string lenght).
- IDN / Homoglyph Detection.
- CSV Export
- Find domains that are identical or confusingly similar to your name/brand/mailing domain name/etc.
- Mix of Edit-based and Token-based textdistance algorithms to increase result quality.
- Domain Creation Date, MX- and A-Record lookups are included but not activated by default.
- Possibility to change pre-defined thresholds of fuzzy-matching algorithms if you want to.

Put your brands or mailing domain names into this list for monitoring operations (without the TLD).

Put here common word collisions you want to exclude from the results to reduce false positives

Download / Extract your Domain Zone TXT File into the path where this programm is running (Program tells you where).

Type in the Name of Domain Zone TXT File you want to monitor (in this example "info" for .info domains). Please keep in mind that process could take time depending on the quantity of analyzed domains, especially for .com domains with over 100.000.000 Million Domains

Written in Python 3.7

TO DO:
- Activate Domain Creation Date as additional csv column
- API Integration from https://github.com/icann/czds-api-client-python and therefore scanning multiple TLD Zones at once
- Add Possibility to parse Arguments (e.g. workers for multithreading, e.g. add nameservers)
- other fixes
